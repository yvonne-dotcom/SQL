#Here I queried a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderid

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT orderID, product,SUM(quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

7# How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
